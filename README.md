# Marvel

In this project, I explore the Marvel API and implement some features within iOS development.

---

## Getting Started

Clone this project, then locate the file named `Config.xcconfig`.  
Inside, replace the public and private API keys with your own keys.  
You can create a Marvel API key here: [Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/)

---

## Project Presentation

This project demonstrates:

- Integration with the Marvel API to fetch characters and comics data  
- Use of Swift and iOS development best practices  
- Example UI showing Marvel characters and details

## App Demonstration - Show around

### 1. Marvel Heroes List  
Int the list, you can scroll down, and more heroes will be fetched dynamically as you keep scrolling.

### 2. Quick Access Tags and Favorites  
In the heroes list you have clickable tags for quick access to more info about the heroes. Also, you can swipe to save or remove heroes to your favorites.

### 3. Accessibility Features in SwiftUI  
I took advantage of SwiftUI's accessibility features. Since most views are in SwiftUI, the app conforms to dynamic text sizing.

### 4. Search and Sort Heroes  
Users can search heroes by name and sort the list dynamically.

### 5. Details View  
Some additional details were added in the character's details view.

### 6. Exploring Favorites Page  
I added a Favorites page where users can see and manage their saved heroes.

## Known Issues / TODO

- Add authentication to securely store and manage Marvel API keys (important for app security).
- Finish localizable strings.
